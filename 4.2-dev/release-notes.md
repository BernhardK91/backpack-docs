# Release Notes

---

**Launch date:** (expected) end of Nov, 2021

Anybody with a 4.0 or 4.1 license can install and use 4.2, but in order to get the new features in a project that currently runs 4.1, you need to [follow the upgrade guide](/docs/{{version}}/upgrade-guide). Don't get fooled by the fact that we kept the 4.x.x prefix - that's just to show that **Backpack 4.2 is a FREE upgrade from 4.1**. But **Backpack 4.2 is a MAJOR new version**, with 12 months of work put into it, and major improvements under-the-hood. It is the current and recommended version of Backpack and it's got so many cool new things that we couldn't fit them all inside this page.

But what Backpack 4.2 brings to the table and why you should upgrade from [Backpack 4.1](/docs/4.1) to 4.2:
